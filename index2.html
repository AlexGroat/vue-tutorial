        /*Details

A component is considered mounted after:

All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside <Suspense> trees).

Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.

This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a server-rendered application.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering. */
